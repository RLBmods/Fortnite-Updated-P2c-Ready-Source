# Fortnite-Updated-P2c-Ready-Source

Paid m1ndyy for him to dev a cheat for me as I am busy with IRL shit. he was asked to change menu and to add features and he was given a week and couldn't do it 

I have a copy of the cheat on my laptop where I did what I told him and it took me 2h. Really unreliable dev. Would not recommand buying from him.

He sent me source and since the guy is incapable of deving and or refunding 60$ which was the initial  pay, I will leak this source. Come with driver and communication.

posting the proof of the scam too

End of the day, not a reliable dev, scammer and wouldn't trust him.
